# Aeonis agent toolkit

This folder is a set of repeatable tools for using an AI assistant without drifting from canon.

## What’s inside

- `roles/`: copy/paste role prompts (System Architect, Balance Analyst, Content Designer, etc.)
- `templates/`: templates for new Lords/cards/events/objectives and playtest reports
- `checklists/`: integration checklists so changes propagate correctly

## Suggested usage pattern

1. Start from `../AGENTS.md` to pick a workflow.
2. Pick a role in `roles/` for the task.
3. Use a template in `templates/` to generate content.
4. Run the relevant checklist in `checklists/` before calling it “done”.
