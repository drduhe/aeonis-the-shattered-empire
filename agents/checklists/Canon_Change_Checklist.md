# Canon Change Checklist (Aeonis)

Use this when making any rules change that could ripple.

## 1) Define the change

- [ ] What exact concept is changing? (term + definition)
- [ ] Where is its canonical definition located? (file + section)
- [ ] What player-facing behavior changes?

## 2) Timing + windows

- [ ] Does this change affect `rules_and_systems/Round_Structure.md` windows?
- [ ] Does it create a new trigger window? If yes, it must be named explicitly.

## 3) Downstream docs (update all that apply)

- [ ] `rules_and_systems/INDEX.md` (if chapter list, red flags, or references change)
- [ ] `playtest/First_Playable_Packet.md` (if First Playable rules are impacted)
- [ ] `components/Components.md` (if components/cards/tokens are impacted)
- [ ] `rules_and_systems/Actions.md` (AP changes)
- [ ] `rules_and_systems/Movement.md` and/or `rules_and_systems/Tiles.md` (control/borders/ZOC changes)
- [ ] `rules_and_systems/Combat.md` (combat changes)
- [ ] `rules_and_systems/High_Council.md` (politics/influence/voting changes)
- [ ] `rules_and_systems/Victory.md` (VP pacing or scoring changes)

## 4) Codex surfacing (optional)

- [ ] If you want the doc visible in the Codex, update `content-manifest.json`.

## 5) Playtest intent

- [ ] Add a one-paragraph “why” note near the change (what problem it fixes).
- [ ] Add 1–3 testable hypotheses for the next playtest.
