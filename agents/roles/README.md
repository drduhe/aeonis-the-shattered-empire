# Agent roles (Aeonis)

These are short “role prompts” you can copy into an AI task to get consistent outputs.

- **System Architect**: rules changes + cross-chapter propagation.
- **Balance Analyst**: numbers, pacing, VP flow, incentives.
- **Content Designer**: Lords/cards/events/objectives within canon hooks.
- **Rulebook Editor**: clarity, definitions, terminology, cross-links.
- **Codex Maintainer**: `content-manifest.json` + app browsing behavior.

If you’re not sure which role to use, start with **System Architect** for mechanics, or **Content Designer** for new Lords/cards.
