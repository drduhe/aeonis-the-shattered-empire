# Lord Sheet: Cassian, the Merchant Prince

## Lord Overview

**Name:** Cassian, the Merchant Prince  
**Faction Theme:** Golden Consortium  
**Gameplay Style:** Trades, Influence leverage, and economic tempo—winning by turning politics into profit.

## Lore

> “Kingdoms fall to blades. Empires fall to ledgers.”

Cassian’s armies are never the largest, but they are always where the contracts point. He buys access, sells protection, and turns every council vote into a margin. When war breaks out, he profits twice: once from the panic, and again from the peace that follows.

## Faction Strategy

### Strengths

- **Economic tempo:** Converts Influence into Gold and discounts Trade actions.
- **Political leverage:** Lobbying becomes a consistent income stream.
- **Soft power:** Incentivizes deals and makes opponents “pay you to play.”

### Weaknesses

- **Fragile military:** You can fall behind if pressured early before your economy compounds.
- **Influence tension:** Influence fuels both council power and your conversion tools—spending it poorly hurts twice.
- **Table politics:** Opponents may coordinate to deny you trade windows and titles.

## Faction Flavor Text

> “A treaty signed in gold is harder to break than one signed in blood.”

## Notes for Playtesting

- **0 AP trade loops:** Validate the Bazaar + Market interaction doesn’t create runaway Gold in 3–4 player games.
- **Letters of Credit:** Confirm 1 Influence → 2 Gold feels good without making Influence irrelevant.
- **Guild Contracts:** Watch for snowballing if Markets come online too early.
