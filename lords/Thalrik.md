# Lord Sheet: Thal'rik, the Gatekeeper

## Lord Overview

**Name:** Thal'rik, the Gatekeeper
**Race:** Voidborn
**Faction Theme:** The Threshold
**Gameplay Style:** Portal control, teleportation, map-wide presence, flexible recruitment, and rapid redeployment.

## Lore

> "You cross my gates because I allow it. Remember that."

The Voidborn are not born -- they coalesce. When the Eternal Empire's portal network collapsed, the dimensional energy that powered it did not simply dissipate. It pooled, congealed, and eventually became aware. The Voidborn emerged from the broken gates as beings of shimmering static, half-real and wholly strange. They remember nothing of the empire, yet the portal network hums in their veins like a mother tongue. Thal'rik is the first of his kind to claim sovereignty, and he considers the portal network his birthright. Every gate is a door in his house, and he does not appreciate uninvited guests.

  - Attack: d6
  - Defense: d6
  - Health: 1
- **1 Archer**
  - Attack: d6
  - Defense: d4
  - Health: 1

- **Thal'rik (Lord / Leader)**
  - Attack: d8
  - Defense: d8
  - Health: 3
  - Movement Range: 2
  - *Design note: Balanced combat stats. Thal'rik's power comes from being everywhere at once, not from winning any single fight decisively.*

### Starting Resources

**Gold:** 2
**Mana:** 3
**Influence:** 1

### Population

**Population Cap / Pool:** 10 / 10

### Starting AP

**Starting AP:** 5

### Unique Starting Tile (replaces your Forest)

**Rift Anchor** (counts as **Forest** for terrain/movement; also functions as a **Portal**)

- **Production:** +1 Mana
- **Building permissions:** You may build a **Tower** here, but you may **not** build a **Grove** here.
- **Special:** This tile functions as a **Portal** for all Portal travel rules. It starts in your home cluster, giving you immediate access to the portal network.
- **Owner-only benefit (only while you control it):** Once per round, when you use Portal travel **from** this tile, the AP cost to enter and exit the Portal is **0** (free transit).

---

## Abilities

### 1) Dimensional Attunement (Faction Mechanic)

**Effect:** You may use **Portal travel** to **any Portal** on the map, including enemy-controlled Portals, without requiring a treaty or High Council motion. Other players still need the normal treaty/motion to travel to your Portals.
**Theme:** The Voidborn perceive all gates as one. Borders drawn by mortals do not apply to the spaces between spaces.

### 2) Threshold Ward (Passive Ability)

**Effect:** When you are **defending** a hex that contains a **Portal** (including Rift Anchor), all your units in that battle gain **+1 Defense** (add +1 to their Defense rolls).
**Theme:** The dimensional static around a portal warps incoming attacks.

### 3) Rift Summon (Active Ability)

**Requirement:** You must control the Portal hex.
**Effect:** Once per round, when you take a **Recruit action**, you may place recruited units in any **Portal hex you control** instead of only in Cities. Normal recruitment costs, Population costs, and the per-City (or per-Portal) recruit limit of 2 units still apply.
**Cost:** No extra cost (replaces normal Recruit location restriction)
**Theme:** The Voidborn pull reinforcements through the gates themselves.

## Faction Research (The Threshold)

### Planar Echo

**Cost:** 3 Mana, 1 Gold (Research action)
**Effect:** Once per round, when you complete a **Move action that included Portal travel**, gain **+1 AP** immediately (must be spent this round).
**Theme:** Momentum carries through the gates -- the Voidborn exit faster than they entered.

### Void Anchor

**Cost:** 2 Mana, 2 Influence (Research action)
**Effect:** Once per round during the **Action Phase**, you may spend **1 Mana** to place a **temporary Void Marker** on any hex you control. Until end of round, that hex counts as a **Portal** for your units only (other players cannot use it for Portal travel). Remove the marker at Cleanup & Checks.
**Theme:** Thal'rik tears open a temporary rift, extending his network into enemy territory.

## Special Units (Future Content)

These are intended for an expanded unit roster beyond the First Playable components.

### Rift Walker

- **Type:** Elite Unit
- **Stats:**
  - Attack: d8
  - Defense: d6
  - Health: 2
- **Special Ability:** This unit may use Portal travel **without physically entering a Portal hex first**. From any hex on the map, it can teleport to any Portal hex you control as a Move action (costs 1 AP). Cannot bring other units with it.
- **Theme:** Rift Walkers phase through space itself -- they do not need a door.

### Void Sentinel

- **Type:** Advanced Unit
- **Stats:**
  - Attack: d6
  - Defense: d10
  - Health: 3
- **Upkeep (suggested):** 1 Mana per round
- **Special Ability:** While this unit is stationed on a **Portal hex**, enemy units **cannot use that Portal** for travel (blocks transit completely). Allies may still use it.
- **Theme:** The Sentinel stands in the threshold and permits none to pass.

## Faction Objectives

### Primary Objective (2 VP): "Master of Thresholds"

Control **2 or more Portal hexes** (including Rift Anchor) at **Cleanup & Checks**.

### Secondary Objective (1 VP): "Everywhere at Once"

Use **Portal travel** at least **twice** in a single round (two separate Move actions that each include Portal transit).

---

## Faction Strategy

### Strengths

- **Map-wide reach:** Dimensional Attunement + Rift Anchor gives Thal'rik unmatched access to every corner of the board from Round 1.
- **Flexible recruitment:** Rift Summon allows reinforcements to appear at distant Portals, enabling rapid force projection without marching.
- **Portal defense:** Threshold Ward makes Thal'rik's Portal hexes natural strongholds.
- **Tempo advantage:** Planar Echo refunds AP for Portal travel, making Thal'rik's turns more action-dense than opponents'.

### Weaknesses

- **Influence-poor:** 1 starting Influence makes early council play and treaty negotiation difficult.
- **Portal dependency:** If opponents contest or blockade Portals, Thal'rik's mobility shrinks dramatically.
- **Average combat:** d8/d8 stats and no attack bonuses mean Thal'rik wins through positioning, not raw power.
- **Mana-hungry:** Portal abilities, Void Anchor, and research all consume Mana. Losing Mana-producing hexes is crippling.

## Faction Flavor Text

> "The empire built the gates to rule the world. They forgot that someone has to hold the keys."

## Notes for Playtesting

- **Dimensional Attunement:** Unrestricted Portal access is very strong. Monitor whether Thal'rik can harass distant players too easily in the early game before they have defenses.
- **Rift Summon:** Recruiting at Portals effectively gives Thal'rik extra "forward bases." Track whether this makes him too hard to contain.
- **Rift Anchor starting Portal:** Having a Portal in the home cluster from Round 1 is unique. Ensure this doesn't trivialize the early expansion phase.
- **Void Anchor (temporary Portal):** This is potentially the strongest ability in the kit -- placing a Portal anywhere you control. Validate that the 1 Mana cost per use + round limit is sufficient constraint.
- **Master of Thresholds (2 Portals):** Depending on map layout, Portals may be heavily contested. Confirm this objective is achievable but requires real effort.
