# Lord Sheet: Nyxara, the Veiled

## Lord Overview

**Name:** Nyxara, the Veiled
**Race:** Umbral
**Faction Theme:** The Silent Court
**Gameplay Style:** Whisper card manipulation, information warfare, surgical strikes, and resource conversion through secrets.

## Lore

> "I heard your plan before you spoke it. The stones tell me everything."

The Umbral are shadow-touched humanoids who dwell in the spaces between light -- born from imperial spymasters who experimented with dimensional phasing during the empire's twilight years. Their skin shimmers like oil on water, and they perceive things hidden from mortal sight. Nyxara rules the Silent Court from no fixed throne; her seat of power is the network of whispers itself. She has never lost a war, because every war she fights is already over before the first blade is drawn.

## Abilities

### 1) Whisper Network (Faction Mechanic)

**Effect:** Draw **3 Whisper Cards** at Round Start instead of the standard 2. Your hand limit is **8** instead of the standard 7.
**Theme:** The Umbral hear more whispers than anyone -- and forget none of them.

### 2) Shadow Sight (Passive Ability)

**Effect:** Once per round, when **another player plays a Whisper Card**, you may choose that player. They must reveal **one card** of their choice from their remaining Whisper hand to you (only you see it).
**Theme:** Every secret spent reveals the shape of secrets kept.

### 3) Veil of Shadows (Active Ability)

**Requirement:** Nyxara must be part of the moving group.
**Effect:** Once per round, when you take a **Move action**, spend **2 Mana**. For this Move action, Nyxara's group **ignores all ZOC penalties** and may **pass through enemy-controlled hexes** without requiring a treaty (cannot end movement on an enemy-controlled hex containing enemy units).
**Cost:** 2 Mana
**Theme:** The Umbral step between dimensions -- walls and borders mean nothing to shadows.

## Faction Research (The Silent Court)

### Stolen Secrets

**Cost:** 2 Mana, 2 Influence (Research action)
**Effect:** Once per round, when you play a Whisper Card with **WHEN** timing, draw **1 Whisper Card** immediately.
**Theme:** Reactions breed intelligence. Every crisis reveals a new thread to pull.

### Shadow Network

**Cost:** 3 Mana, 1 Gold (Research action)
**Effect:** Once per round, you may **discard 1 Whisper Card** from your hand to gain **2 Gold** or **2 Influence** (your choice).
**Theme:** Information is currency -- the Silent Court trades in both.

## Special Units (Future Content)

These are intended for an expanded unit roster beyond the First Playable components.

### Shade Assassin

- **Type:** Elite Unit
- **Stats:**
  - Attack: d10
  - Defense: d4
  - Health: 1
- **Special Ability:** This unit may be placed directly on the Battle Line **after** both sides have committed (as an ambush). It takes its attack before normal Battle Line resolution but after any Pre-Strike. If it kills its target, it is removed from the Battle Line and returned to Reserves.
- **Theme:** Appears from nowhere, strikes once, vanishes.

### Whisperer

- **Type:** Advanced Unit
- **Stats:**
  - Attack: d6
  - Defense: d8
  - Health: 2
- **Upkeep (suggested):** 1 Mana per round
- **Special Ability:** At the start of each **Battle Round** (if committed to battle), you may force one opponent in the battle to reveal **1 Whisper Card** from their hand. If it has COMBAT timing, you may choose to cancel it (the card is discarded without effect).
- **Theme:** The Whisperer drowns out enemy secrets with their own.

---

## Faction Objectives

### Primary Objective (2 VP): "The Silent Coup"

Play **4 or more Whisper Cards** in a single round.

### Secondary Objective (1 VP): "Unseen Hand"

Gain control of a hex that was previously controlled by another player **without initiating an Attack action** (via Whisper Card effects, Influence events, or other non-combat means).

---

## Faction Strategy

### Strengths

- **Card advantage:** Drawing 3-4 Whispers per round builds an enormous hand of tactical options.
- **Information dominance:** Shadow Sight lets you peek at opponent plans, informing your decisions.
- **Flexible economy:** Shadow Network converts surplus Whispers into Gold or Influence.
- **Unpredictable movement:** Veil of Shadows makes Nyxara nearly impossible to block.

### Weaknesses

- **Fragile Lord:** d10 Attack / d4 Defense / 2 HP -- Nyxara is the easiest Lord to kill. She should never be committed to a battle she might lose.
- **Standard army:** No starting Cavalry and no combat bonuses mean the Silent Court fights at par; Nyxara's edge is tactical, not military.
- **Mana-hungry:** Veil of Shadows, Stolen Secrets, and the Obsidian Spire all revolve around Mana, creating a bottleneck.
- **Reactive playstyle:** The Silent Court is strongest when responding to others; if no one gives Nyxara information to exploit, her edge shrinks.

## Faction Flavor Text

> "You think you chose to attack me. Adorable."

## Notes for Playtesting

- **Whisper Network + Obsidian Spire:** Drawing 4 Whispers per round is very strong. Monitor whether the hand size becomes oppressive or whether the 8-card limit is a sufficient brake.
- **Shadow Sight:** Ensure the "reveal one card" mechanic doesn't slow down play. Consider whether Nyxara (not the opponent) should choose which card is revealed.
- **Nyxara's fragility:** At d4 Defense and 2 HP, a single Infantry with a good roll can threaten her life. Validate that this creates exciting risk/reward rather than making her unplayable in combat.
- **The Silent Coup (4 Whispers in a round):** Confirm this is achievable but not trivially easy with 3-4 draws per round.
