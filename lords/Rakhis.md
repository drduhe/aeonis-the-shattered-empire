# Lord Sheet: Rakhis, the Sandlord

## Lord Overview

**Name:** Rakhis, the Sandlord
**Race:** Djinnborn
**Faction Theme:** The Windsworn Horde
**Gameplay Style:** Fast cavalry aggression, desert mastery, wide territorial expansion, and hit-and-run warfare.

## Lore

> "The desert does not conquer. It simply outlasts everything that stands still."

The Djinnborn are the descendants of imperial outriders who bound wind spirits into their bloodline during the empire's golden age. When the empire fell, they retreated into the deep deserts and thrived where others perished. Rakhis commands the largest mounted host in Aeonis -- not through gold or titles, but through the simple promise that those who ride with him will never be cornered. His Horde moves like weather: visible on the horizon, impossible to catch, devastating when it arrives.

## Abilities

### 1) Windsworn Speed (Faction Mechanic)

**Effect:** All your units treat **Deserts** as costing **1 AP per hex** (instead of 2 AP). Other players still pay the normal 2 AP.
**Theme:** The Djinnborn were born in the sand. What slows others is home to them.

### 2) Hit and Run (Passive Ability)

**Effect:** Once per round, when you **win a battle as the attacker**, your surviving committed units may immediately move **1 hex** to any adjacent hex you control or any adjacent neutral hex. This movement does not cost AP and does not count as a Move action.
**Theme:** The Horde strikes and vanishes before the dust settles.

### 3) Desert Tempest (Active Ability)

**Requirement:** Rakhis must be within **2 hexes** of the chosen Desert.
**Effect:** Once per round during the Action Phase, spend **2 Mana**. Choose one **Desert** hex you control. Until end of round, that hex costs **+2 additional AP** for other players to enter (total 4 AP for opponents).
**Cost:** 2 Mana
**Theme:** Wind and sand become a wall when Rakhis commands them.

## Faction Research (Windsworn Horde)

### Mirage Riders

**Cost:** 3 Gold, 1 Mana (Research action)
**Effect:** Your Cavalry gain **+1 Attack** (add +1 to their Attack rolls) when attacking from a **Desert** hex (the hex they committed from is a Desert).
**Theme:** Heat shimmer and speed make the charge impossible to read.

### Sandsworn Pact

**Cost:** 2 Influence, 2 Gold (Research action)
**Effect:** Once per round, when you claim a **neutral hex** by moving a unit into it, gain **+1 Gold**.
**Theme:** Every new territory is a trade route waiting to open.

## Special Units (Future Content)

These are intended for an expanded unit roster beyond the First Playable components.

### Windrunner

- **Type:** Elite Unit (Cavalry)
- **Stats:**
  - Attack: d10
  - Defense: d6
  - Health: 2
- **Special Ability:** Movement Range 3 (instead of the normal Cavalry 2). During a Move action, this unit's group treats all terrain as costing **1 AP per hex** (including Mountains).
- **Theme:** Riders who have fully bonded with their wind spirits.

### Dust Wraith

- **Type:** Advanced Unit
- **Stats:**
  - Attack: d8
  - Defense: d8
  - Health: 2
- **Upkeep (suggested):** 1 Mana per round
- **Special Ability:** When this unit enters a battle as part of the attacking force, choose one enemy **Reserve** unit. That unit must be placed on the enemy Battle Line (if there is room), potentially displacing the defender's preferred lineup.
- **Theme:** A sandstorm given form -- it reaches behind the front line.

## Faction Objectives

### Primary Objective (2 VP): "Endless Horizon"

Control **3 Desert** hexes at **Cleanup & Checks**.

### Secondary Objective (1 VP): "Lightning Raid"

Win a battle as **attacker** and use **Hit and Run** to move your units afterward in the same round.

---

## Faction Strategy

### Strengths

- **Map mobility:** Movement Range 3 Lord + Windsworn Speed means Rakhis can be anywhere Deserts touch.
- **Desert dominance:** Desert Tempest makes contested deserts punishingly expensive for opponents.
- **Aggressive tempo:** Hit and Run lets you win a fight and immediately reposition, denying counterattack.
- **Cavalry start:** Beginning with Cavalry gives an early expansion advantage no other Lord has.

### Weaknesses

- **Mana drought:** 1 starting Mana makes Desert Tempest and research expensive early.
- **Fragile in sieges:** Speed doesn't help when assaulting fortified positions; the Horde is weakest when forced to stand still.
- **Desert dependency:** If the map has few Deserts near your position, Windsworn Speed and Desert Tempest lose value.
- **Thin defenses:** d6 Defense on Rakhis and most units means any sustained fight is risky.

## Faction Flavor Text

> "You built walls. I built legs. Let's see which lasts longer."

## Notes for Playtesting

- **Windsworn Speed:** Verify that free Desert movement doesn't let Rakhis dominate neutral ring Deserts too easily in early rounds.
- **Hit and Run:** Track how often the free move creates unreachable positions; ensure opponents have counterplay (ZOC from adjacent units should still work).
- **Desert Tempest:** At 4 AP total for opponents, this can effectively lock a hex. Confirm 2 Mana is the right cost and that it doesn't stall the game.
- **Cavalry start:** Validate that starting with Cavalry instead of an Archer isn't too strong for Round 1 aggression.
