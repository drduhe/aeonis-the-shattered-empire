# Lord Sheet: Auriel, Voice of the World Tree

## Lord Overview

**Name:** Auriel, Voice of the World Tree
**Race:** Luminari
**Faction Theme:** The Radiant Accord
**Gameplay Style:** Renown accumulation, council dominance, defensive auras, and cultural victory through faith and political mastery.

## Lore

> "The Tree remembers every oath sworn and every oath broken. So do I."

The Luminari are crystalline beings formed from the sap of the World Tree King during the empire's final cataclysm. Neither born nor made, they emerged fully conscious, carrying fragments of divine memory. They see themselves as the Tree's living will -- its voice in a world that has forgotten how to listen. Auriel is the eldest of their kind, a being of radiant calm and terrifying conviction. She does not conquer; she consecrates. And those who stand on consecrated ground find it very difficult to stand against her.

## Abilities

### 1) Divine Mandate (Faction Mechanic)

**Effect:** Whenever a **High Council motion** that you voted **"for"** passes, gain **+1 Renown**. This applies to any motion (not just ones you proposed), as long as you cast at least one vote in favor and the motion is approved.
**Theme:** The World Tree rewards those who shape the law. Every motion that passes with Auriel's blessing strengthens her divine claim.

### 2) Radiant Presence (Passive Ability)

**Effect:** While **Auriel is committed** to a battle (on the Battle Line or in Reserves), all your units on the **Battle Line** gain **+1 Defense** (add +1 to their Defense rolls).
**Theme:** The Tree's light shields those who fight beside its Voice.

### 3) Exaltation (Active Ability)

**Requirement:** Must be your turn during the **Action Phase**.
**Effect:** As an **ACTION** on your turn (costs **0 AP**, but consumes your turn), spend **3 Influence** to gain **+2 Renown** immediately.
**Cost:** 3 Influence, 0 AP (takes your turn)
**Theme:** Auriel raises a hymn to the World Tree, and the land itself acknowledges her authority.

## Faction Objectives

### Primary Objective (2 VP): "Righteous Mandate"

Have **8 or more Renown** at **Cleanup & Checks**.

### Secondary Objective (1 VP): "Voice of Authority"

Win **2 or more High Council votes** in a single round (motions you voted "for" that passed).

---

## Faction Strategy

### Strengths

- **Renown engine:** Divine Mandate + Exaltation + Hallowed Grove create the fastest Renown accumulation in the game.
- **Council powerhouse:** High starting Influence and Renown synergies make Auriel dominant in the political game.
- **Defensive fortress:** d10 Defense Lord + Radiant Presence + Luminous Bulwark creates layers of defense that are extremely hard to crack.
- **Alternative VP path:** Sacred Rite awards VP for Renown milestones, giving Auriel a victory route that doesn't require military conquest.

### Weaknesses

- **Low offense:** d6 Attack on Auriel and no attack bonuses mean the Radiant Accord struggles to win battles as the aggressor.
- **Gold-poor:** 1 starting Gold and no Gold bonuses make early building and recruitment expensive.
- **Council dependency:** If the High Council is inactive (few motions, vetoes), Divine Mandate generates little value.
- **Slow ramp:** Auriel's power scales with Renown, which takes time to accumulate. She's vulnerable to early aggression before her defenses crystallize.

## Faction Flavor Text

> "You see a throne. I see a root system. The Tree does not sit upon the land -- it holds the land together."

## Notes for Playtesting

- **Divine Mandate:** Track how many Renown Auriel gains per round through council votes. In an 8-player game with many motions, this could snowball quickly.
- **Exaltation (3 Influence for +2 Renown):** Validate that the Influence cost is steep enough. Auriel generates Influence from Hallowed Grove (+1/round) and her starting resources (3), so she could fire this early.
- **Sacred Rite (VP from Renown thresholds):** This awards up to 2 VP from a single research. Confirm that reaching 5 and 10 Renown requires enough effort that these VP feel earned.
- **Radiant Presence + Luminous Bulwark stacking:** With both active, defending units in a building hex with Auriel committed could have +2 Defense. Ensure this doesn't make positions unbreakable.
