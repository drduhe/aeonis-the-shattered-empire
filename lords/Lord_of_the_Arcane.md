# Lord Sheet: Seraphel, Lord of the Arcane

## Lord Overview

**Name:** Seraphel, Lord of the Arcane  
**Faction Theme:** The Arcanum Concord  
**Gameplay Style:** Mana advantage, information control, and flexible tempo through efficient combat pacing.

## Lore

> “The battlefield is only a diagram. I prefer to win with the first stroke of chalk.”

Seraphel’s court is a lattice of wards, lenses, and quiet bargains. Where other Lords contest the map with force, Seraphel contests it with **timing**—seeing the agenda before it opens, choosing where battles happen, and turning a single Attack action into a decisive cascade. In the Arcanum Concord, knowledge is not power; it is permission.

## Abilities

### 1) Arcane Efficiency (Passive Ability)

**Effect:** Once per round, when you **Press the Attack**, the +1 AP cost is reduced to **0 AP**.  
**Theme:** You compress time—turning a single opening into a full exchange of blows.

### 2) Scry the Council (Passive Ability)

**Effect:** At the start of the **High Council Phase**, you may look at the top card of the **agenda deck** (First Playable rule) and put it back.  
**Theme:** Your diviners hear the argument before it is spoken.

### 3) Blink Step (Active Ability)

**Requirement:** Seraphel must be part of the **moving group**.  
**Effect:** Once per round, when you take a **Move** action, you may spend **2 Mana**. If you do, treat **Mountains** and **Deserts** as costing **1 AP per hex** for that Move action (instead of 2 AP per hex).  
**Cost:** 2 Mana  
**Theme:** A step across ley lines is faster than any road.

## Faction Research (Arcanum Concord)

### Mana Nexus (Lord-Specific Discovery)

**Cost:** 4 Mana, 1 Gold (Research action)  
**Effect:** Your controlled **Mana-producing** hexes (Forests/Groves/unique Mana tiles) produce **+1 additional Mana**.  
**Theme:** You widen the conduits; the land itself becomes a focus.

### Spellweave Doctrine

**Cost:** 2 Mana, 2 Influence (Research action)  
**Effect:** Once per round, after you lobby on a High Council vote (spend any Influence during **Lobbying**), gain **1 Mana**.  
**Theme:** Politics is just another ritual circle.

  - Defense: d6
  - Health: 2

- **Special Ability:** Once per battle round, after this unit deals damage, you may immediately choose a new target for one of your other Battle Line units (retarget before its roll).  
- **Theme:** A duel is just a spell with sharp edges.

  - Attack: d6

- **Theme:** Seeing the strike before the arm moves.

---

## Faction Objectives

### Primary Objective (2 VP): “Ritual Ascendance”

End a round with **10 Mana** and control **at least 2 Forest/Grove** hexes.

### Secondary Objective (1 VP): “Calculated Violence”

In a single round, resolve **Press the Attack** at least **twice** across your attacks (this can be across multiple Attack actions), and win at least one of those battles.

---

## Faction Strategy

### Strengths

- **AP conversion:** Free Press the Attack creates huge tempo swings in key fights.
- **Information edge:** Scry the Council improves negotiation and counterplay in politics.
- **Terrain flexibility:** Blink Step reduces the penalty of Mountains/Deserts for repositioning.

### Weaknesses

- **Mana hungry:** Blink Step and research both compete for the same resource.
- **Thin early economy:** Low starting Gold can delay defensive infrastructure.
- **Threat perception:** Efficient burst turns often make you the table’s priority target.

## Faction Flavor Text

> “When the ritual is complete, even victory feels inevitable.”

## Notes for Playtesting

- **Arcane Efficiency:** Track how often “free Press” produces blowouts; tune once-per-round timing if needed.
- **Blink Step:** Verify it’s a meaningful mobility tool without trivializing terrain as a strategic feature.
- **Mana Nexus scaling:** Confirm +1 Mana on all Mana-hexes doesn’t outpace other economies too early.
