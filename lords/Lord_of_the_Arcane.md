## Starting Setup

- **Starting AP**: 5
- **Starting resources**: 1 Gold, 4 Mana, 1 Influence
- **Population Cap / Pool**: 10 / 10
- **Starting units**: 2 Infantry, 1 Archer (in Home City)

### Unique Starting Tile (replaces your Forest)

- **Production**: +2 Mana
- **Building permissions**: You may build a **Tower** here, but you may **not** build a **Grove** here.

## Faction Ability: Arcane Efficiency

Once per round, when you **Press the Attack**, the +1 AP cost is reduced to **0 AP**.

---

## Faction Ability: Scry the Council

At the start of the **High Council Phase**, you may look at the top card of the **agenda deck** (First Playable rule) and put it back.

---

## First Playable Lord Objective (2 VP)

**Ritual Ascendance**: End a round with **10 Mana** and control **at least 2 Forest/Grove tiles**.

## Restrictions / Notes

- This Lord is intended to test whether “Press the Attack” is fun when discounted.
