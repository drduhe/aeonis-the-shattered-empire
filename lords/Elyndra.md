# Lord Sheet: Elyndra, Warden of Groves

## Lord Overview

**Name:** Elyndra, Warden of Groves  
**Faction Theme:** Verdant Covenant  
**Gameplay Style:** Population growth, holding ground, and winning wars of attrition from fortified forests.

## Lore

> “You see trees. I see a thousand hands ready to pull you under.”

Elyndra does not rule by decree—she rules by **roots**. Where others strip the land for immediate power, her domain becomes denser, harder to invade, and increasingly self-sustaining. Enemies who linger find their supply lines strangled and their formations broken by unseen growth and patient guardians.

## Faction Strategy

### Strengths

- **Population advantage:** You replace losses quickly and can sustain longer conflicts.
- **Defensive consistency:** Rerolls and attack suppression make forest fights favorable.
- **Archer value:** Forest defense tools amplify Pre-Strike and chip damage.

### Weaknesses

- **Terrain reliance:** You are strongest in Forest/Grove hexes; open ground is riskier.
- **Build constraints:** Sacred Grove’s restrictions can bottleneck early Mana scaling.
- **Mana pressure:** Your combat control spends Mana you also want for research/spells.

## Faction Flavor Text

> “The forest does not chase you. It simply waits until you cannot run.”

## Notes for Playtesting

- **Growth tuning:** Verdant Growth + Sacred Grove owner-only is intentionally generous—verify it doesn’t outpace other factions too early.
- **Entangling Roots feel:** Roll-modifying effects can be swingy; confirm -2 is impactful but not oppressive.
- **Forest dominance:** Test map setups with fewer Forests to see if Elyndra remains viable without guaranteed terrain.
