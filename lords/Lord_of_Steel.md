# Lord Sheet: Vharok, the Lord of Steel

## Lord Overview

**Name:** Vharok, the Lord of Steel  
**Faction Theme:** Iron Dominion  
**Gameplay Style:** Durable fronts, fortress play, and grinding attackers down through long sieges.

## Lore

> “Strike the wall if you must. You will only learn what it costs to move the unmovable.”

Vharok rules from forge-lit bastions where every road is measured, every gate is trapped, and every war is fought on terms he has engineered. His armies do not race to victory—they **deny** it to others. When conflict comes, Vharok’s domain becomes a battlefield of choke points, iron discipline, and siege lines that refuse to break.

## Abilities

### 1) Forged in Battle (Passive Ability)

**Effect:** When defending a hex that contains **one of your buildings**, your units gain **+1 Defense**. (Add +1 to their Defense rolls in that battle.)  
**Theme:** Steel discipline behind walls and fortifications.

### 2) Siegecraft (Passive Ability)

**Effect:** When you spend an **Attack** action against a hex that is currently a **Siege** (City holding the walls, or any Fortress), you may resolve **Press the Attack** by paying **0 AP** instead of +1 (still limited to once per Attack action).  
**Theme:** Your war engines are built to sustain pressure without exhausting your command.

### 3) Lock the Line (Active Ability)

**Requirement:** Vharok must be **committed** to this battle.  
**Effect:** Once per battle round, after targets are declared but before any dice are rolled, you may spend **1 Mana** to **reassign up to two** of the attacker’s declared targets (the attacker chooses new legal targets for those units).  
**Cost:** 1 Mana  
**Theme:** Shield walls and battlefield control—your defenders force the enemy into bad trades.

### Siege Logistics

**Effect:** Once per round, after you resolve an **Attack** action against a City/Fortress, gain **+1 AP** (this AP must be spent this round).

At **Cleanup & Checks**, control **2 or more** hexes that each contain **one of your buildings**.

---

## Faction Strategy

### Strengths

- **Defensive scaling:** Buildings and towers compound into very high defense.
- **Siege pacing:** Siegecraft lets you push multi-round fights without draining AP.
- **Board control:** Lock the Line helps dictate casualty trades and protect key units.

### Weaknesses

- **Tempo risk:** Heavy building and siege play can fall behind on wide expansion.
- **Mana-light:** Your active control tool competes with other Mana uses (research/spells).
- **Predictable front:** Opponents can coordinate around your choke points if you overcommit.

## Faction Flavor Text

> “In time, every army learns the same truth: steel does not tire.”

## Notes for Playtesting

- **Stacking defense:** Validate how Forged in Battle stacks with Tower/Fortress bonuses; watch for “no-damage” stalemates.
- **Siegecraft economy:** Confirm that free Press the Attack during sieges doesn’t become the default best line every turn.
- **Lock the Line feel:** Ensure target reassignment is strong but not frustrating—especially with Archer Pre-Strike timing.
