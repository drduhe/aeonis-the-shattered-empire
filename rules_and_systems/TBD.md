1. Combat System

You might need a detailed and engaging combat system to handle battles between Lords and NPCs. This system should include:
• Unit Types and Abilities: Unique strengths, weaknesses, and costs for units (e.g., infantry, cavalry, siege engines, magical units).
• Battle Resolution: A dice-based, card-based, or deterministic system for resolving combat (e.g., dice rolls modified by unit stats, terrain, or abilities).
• Tactical Depth: Include mechanics like flanking, terrain advantages, or special combat abilities for units and Lords.

1. Economy and Trade

While resources (Gold, Mana, Influence) are already present, we could expand the economy system to include:
• Trade: Players trade resources, alliances, or promises for future benefits (e.g., "I give you Mana now, but you support me in the High Council").
• Market System: A dynamic market where resource values fluctuate due to events or supply and demand.
• Taxes or Upkeep: Introduce a taxation mechanic tied to the High Council, or upkeep costs for units/buildings to maintain balance.

1. Diplomacy System

Expand interaction with other players and NPC factions through diplomatic mechanics:
• Alliances: Temporary agreements with benefits and penalties for breaking them.
• High Council Influence: Build out a full voting and negotiation system where players propose and vote on laws that impact the game.
• NPC Factions: Interact with neutral groups on the map (e.g., recruit their units, gain their resources, or fight them for control).

1. Movement System

A movement system determines how units traverse the map and interact with terrain:
• Action Points or Hex Limits: Define movement rules for unit groups.
• Terrain Effects: Tiles like Lakes or Mountains could require special abilities, spells, or infrastructure for movement.
• Portals and Teleportation: Flesh out how these dynamic movement options interact with the map and strategy.

1. Hex Control and Zone Influence

Add mechanics around control and influence over the map:
• Borders: Define zones of control for players (e.g., extending from Cities or units).
• Neutral Hexes: Rules for gaining control of unclaimed tiles.
• Strategic Hexes: Certain tiles provide unique bonuses (e.g., artifacts, special resources) when controlled.

1. Player Interaction and Negotiation

Build systems to encourage direct player interaction:
• Agreements and Deals: Allow players to form trade agreements, non-aggression pacts, or alliances through a structured system.
• Sabotage or Espionage: Players spend resources or use cards to disrupt opponents (e.g., stealing resources, revealing hidden objectives).

1. Endgame and Scoring Mechanics

Refine how the game transitions to the endgame and resolves ties:
• Dynamic Endgame Triggers: Include alternate ways to trigger the final round (e.g., controlling the Throne of Power, building a certain number of Legendary Buildings, or reaching a VP milestone).
• Secret Objectives: Add hidden scoring elements revealed during final scoring to keep players guessing until the very end.

1. Replayability Enhancements
   • Randomized Setup: Introduce modular hex maps or shuffled objectives/events to make each game unique.
   • Faction Asymmetry: Expand on Lord-specific traits, abilities, and discovery paths for highly varied playstyles.
   • Advanced Rules/Variants: Include optional rules or scenarios for experienced players, like time-limited turns or cooperative play against a powerful NPC Lord.

2. Player Accessibility Systems

Make the game intuitive and approachable:
• Player Aids: Include quick-reference guides for actions, card abilities, and resource costs.
• Tutorial Scenarios: Design a simplified game mode to ease players into the mechanics.
• Streamlined Turn Flow: Ensure turns are snappy and engaging by minimizing downtime with simultaneous planning phases or shared decision moments.

Next Steps

If you feel any of these systems resonate with your vision for Aeonis, we can dive into designing them in detail. Alternatively, we can focus on refining existing systems to ensure smooth integration. Let me know where you’d like to focus!
