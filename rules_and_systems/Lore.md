## Prologue: The Fall of the Eternal Throne

A hundred years ago, the Eternal Empire, which had ruled unbroken for millennia, collapsed under the weight of its own ambition. Its sprawling cities, once beacons of culture and knowledge, fell to ruin as warlords, traitors, and forgotten gods tore the land asunder. The Emperor, wielding a fabled artifact said to grant immortality, vanished from history, leaving the throne vacant and the empire’s heart shattered. The collapse ushered in an age of darkness, where survival replaced ambition, and the world descended into chaos.

From the ashes of the empire rose a new age: one of fractured kingdoms, vying factions, and banished lords seeking to reclaim their birthright. In this age of uncertainty, whispers of rediscovered magic and ancient relics spread across the land, igniting a fierce competition for dominance. The realm, known simply as Aeonis, lies on the brink of renewal or oblivion, where legends will shape its destiny.

## The Speaking Stones: Voices of the Lost Empire

Central to this fractured world are the Palantír, or Speaking Stones—fragments of ancient, enchanted obsidian carved by the empire’s master artisans. These artifacts were once used by the Emperor’s council to govern the vast empire, enabling instantaneous communication and foresight. When the empire fell, the Speaking Stones were lost, scattered across Aeonis. In the present, each lord possesses one of these stones, their whispers guiding them with cryptic visions of the past and glimpses of the future.

These stones are both a gift and a curse. They allow lords to commune with other realms, forge alliances, or uncover hidden secrets. But the stones also serve as conduits for dark forces, their whispers revealing secrets that may drive a lord to greatness—or madness.

## The Rediscovery of Magic

The empire’s collapse was not merely political but arcane. During its golden age, the Eternal Empire drew upon the World Tree’s power, a mythical source of magic said to bridge the mortal and divine realms. However, in their hubris, imperial mages delved too deep, awakening ancient forces that shattered the balance between the mundane and the arcane.

Now, a century later, magic resurges. Forbidden schools of necromancy, evocation, and enchantment resurface, and ruins of the old empire hide spellbooks, artifacts, and forgotten knowledge. Lords race to harness this power, knowing that those who command magic will shape the future of Aeonis. But magic is fickle and dangerous, and its rediscovery has awoken dark beings who remember the empire’s sins.

## The Banished Lords

Among the contenders for the shattered throne are the banished lords—exiled rulers, outcasts, and descendants of the empire’s betrayed allies. Cast into shadow during the empire’s zenith, they now return to reclaim what was taken from them. Each lord represents a unique faction or species, from the elven stewards of the forest who were betrayed by the Emperor’s expansionist greed, to the infernal warlocks banished for their forbidden pacts.

These lords are bound by a singular goal: recognition. To claim the throne and the immortality it grants, a lord must rise above their peers, commanding armies, forging alliances, and amassing renown. Yet, the throne is cursed, its previous claimants mysteriously killed, as if the empire itself rejects unworthy rulers.

## Aeonis: A Fractured Land

The world of Aeonis is a single, sprawling landmass, its geography shaped by the collapse of the empire. Great cities lie in ruin, their spires overtaken by wilderness. Vast plains, dense forests, jagged mountains, scorching deserts, and treacherous lakes dominate the landscape, each hiding resources, mysteries, and dangers.

The remnants of the empire’s glory can be seen in shattered monuments, underground vaults, and ancient roads. Some hexes hold ruins teeming with treasure, while others conceal deadly traps or monstrous guardians. At the center of Aeonis lies the Imperial Seat, a colossal city where the throne remains empty, waiting for a worthy ruler.

## Artifacts of the Old Empire

Among the most coveted prizes in Aeonis are the artifacts of the Eternal Empire. These relics, imbued with divine and arcane power, grant immense advantages to those who wield them. From the Emperor’s Scepter, said to command the elements, to the Helm of Dominion, which bends the will of others, these treasures are the keys to victory.

But such power comes at a cost. The artifacts are bound to the empire’s fate, and their use draws the attention of dark forces. Some lords wield them as tools of conquest, while others seek to destroy them, fearing their corruption.

## Religion and the Divine

The fall of the empire rekindled faith in the old gods. Foremost among them is the World Tree King, a deity believed to govern the balance of life and magic. His roots extend across Aeonis, intertwining with the land and its people. Yet, other, darker gods lurk in the shadows, whispering promises of power to those desperate enough to listen.

The interplay of divine influence shapes the fate of lords and their factions. High priests, sacred rites, and religious conflicts become tools in the struggle for power. Some lords embrace their divine heritage, while others defy the gods, seeking dominion through mortal strength alone.

## Claiming the Throne

The throne of the Eternal Empire remains unclaimed, its seat empty and its promise of immortality unfulfilled. Many have sought it, but all have perished, their ambitions consumed by betrayal, madness, or forces unseen. To claim the throne, a lord must gather renown, command vast armies, and uncover the empire’s deepest secrets.

Yet, the path is fraught with peril. The High Council—a relic of the empire’s bureaucracy—serves as both ally and obstacle, shaping the realm through political maneuvering. The lords must navigate its treacherous motions, balancing cooperation and rivalry to achieve their goals.

## Epilogue: Legends Rise

In this dark age, lords rise. Each wields their Speaking Stone, a fragment of the empire’s legacy, guiding them through the chaos. Each seeks the immortality of the throne, yet none can claim it alone. Alliances will be forged, betrayals unleashed, and battles waged as Aeonis’s fate is decided.

The Shattered Empire awaits its ruler. Will you be the one to unite the realm, or will your ambition doom it to eternal ruin?

The choice is yours my lord.
