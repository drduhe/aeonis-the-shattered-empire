# Aeonis: Events

## Overview

The Event System introduces dynamic, unpredictable elements that enhance replayability and immerse players in the evolving story of the game. Events are triggered through exploration, High Council decisions, milestones, or game-wide effects. They create opportunities and challenges, often forcing impactful decisions that shape the game state.

---

## Event Types

### 1. Exploration Events

- **Trigger:** When a player enters an unexplored hex during the Action Phase.
- **Timing:** Resolve **immediately upon entry** (see `Round_Structure.md`, section 5.3).
- **Outcome:** Each hex has a corresponding event card with results such as discovering resources, encountering NPCs, triggering traps, or finding ruins.

### 2. Global Events

- **Trigger:** Drawn and resolved during the **Event Phase** (see `Round_Structure.md`, section 2).
- **Effect:** Impact all players, creating realm-wide challenges or opportunities. Examples: natural disasters, increased resource production, or temporary rule changes.

### 3. Localized Events

- **Trigger:** Impact specific hexes, factions, or resources.
- **Effect:** Examples include rebellions, magical corruption, or hex-specific penalties/bonuses.

### 4. Milestone Events

- **Trigger:** Reaching specific game milestones, such as earning 10 Renown, building a Legendary structure, or controlling a key number of hexes.
- **Effect:** Significant, story-driven events with game-changing consequences.

## Event Triggers

1. **Exploration:** Drawing an Exploration Event card reveals the hex's contents. Outcomes may include rewards, obstacles, or both.

2. **High Council Decisions:** Passing certain motions can trigger events, such as realm-wide decrees or localized effects.

3. **Event Phase (each round):** A Global Event card is drawn at the start of the Event Phase and resolved immediately.

4. **Artifacts and Spells:** Specific artifacts or spells trigger localized or game-wide events.

5. **Milestones:** Reaching significant game achievements unleashes powerful, thematic events.

## Event Outcomes

### Rewards

- Players gain resources, Renown, or artifacts through beneficial event results.

### Challenges

- Some events introduce obstacles, such as:
  - Hex penalties (e.g., reduced resource production).
  - Immediate costs (e.g., losing units or resources).
  - Defending against invaders or quelling rebellions.

### Choices

- Many events require players to make strategic decisions:
  - Aid a settlement for Renown at a resource cost.
  - Exploit a magical anomaly for resources but risk long-term penalties.

### Persistent Effects

- Certain events permanently affect hexes or the game state (e.g., a hex becomes corrupted and produces no resources).

## Catch-Up Events (canon)

These events specifically help trailing players stay competitive. They are mixed into the global event deck and create moments where falling behind is not a death spiral.

### Populist Uprising

- **Type:** Global Event
- **Effect:** The player(s) with the **fewest controlled hexes** gain **+2 Population Pool** (up to cap) and **+1 Influence**. If tied for fewest, all tied players gain the bonus.

### Winds of Fortune

- **Type:** Global Event
- **Effect:** The player(s) with the **fewest VP** gain **+2 AP** next round (added during Round Start) and may **draw one additional objective card** (public or secret, their choice; if the objective deck is empty, gain +1 Renown instead). If tied for fewest VP, all tied players gain the bonus.

## Synergy with Other Systems

### 1. High Council Influence

- Some events may only occur if a motion is passed, reinforcing the political layer. Example: Passing a "Realm Tax" motion leads to increased Gold but reduces Influence.

### 2. Exploration and Risk/Reward

- Hex exploration becomes a calculated risk, as events can offer rewards (e.g., resources, artifacts) or penalties (e.g., traps, invaders).

### 3. Renown Synergy

- Certain events grant or deduct Renown based on the player's choices, reinforcing the fame/reputation mechanic.

### 4. Action Points (AP) Impact

- Events may modify AP directly:
  - Example: "Unrest: Lose 1 AP unless you spend 2 Influence."
  - Example: "Festival: Gain +1 AP this round."

### 5. Population System

- Events like famine or rebellion tie directly into the Population System, introducing penalties or opportunities to grow.

## Example Events

### Exploration Event: Ancient Ruins

- **Description:** You stumble upon the remains of a forgotten temple.
- **Options:**
    1. Search the ruins. Roll a die: On a 4+, gain 1 Artifact. On 3 or less, lose 1 unit to a trap.
    2. Leave the ruins untouched. Gain +1 Renown for your caution.

### Global Event: Harsh Winter

- **Description:** A brutal winter strikes the realm.
- **Effect:** Each player loses 2 Gold unless they control at least 1 Farm.

### Localized Event: Rebellion

- **Description:** The population of a hex revolts against your rule.
- **Effect:** The hex produces no resources until 2 Influence is spent to quell the unrest.
