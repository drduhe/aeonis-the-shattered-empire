# Aeonis: Events

## Overview
The Event System introduces dynamic, unpredictable elements that enhance replayability and immerse players in the evolving story of the game. Events are triggered through exploration, High Council decisions, milestones, or game-wide effects at the start or end of a round. They create opportunities and challenges, often forcing impactful decisions that shape the game state.

## Event Types

### **1. Exploration Events**
- **Trigger:** When a player enters an unexplored hex.
- **Outcome:** Each hex has a corresponding event card with results such as discovering resources, encountering NPCs, triggering traps, or finding ruins.

### **2. Global Events**
- **Trigger:** Occur at the beginning or end of a round.
- **Effect:** Impact all players equally, creating realm-wide challenges or opportunities. Examples: natural disasters, increased resource production, or temporary rule changes.

### **3. Localized Events**
- **Trigger:** Impact specific hexes, factions, or resources.
- **Effect:** Examples include rebellions, magical corruption, or hex-specific penalties/bonuses.

### **4. Milestone Events**
- **Trigger:** Reaching specific game milestones, such as earning 10 Renown, building a Legendary structure, or controlling a key number of hexes.
- **Effect:** Significant, story-driven events with game-changing consequences.

## Event Triggers

1. **Exploration:**
    - Drawing an Exploration Event card reveals the hex's contents. Outcomes may include rewards, obstacles, or both.

2. **High Council Decisions:**
    - Passing certain motions can trigger events, such as realm-wide decrees or localized effects (e.g., increased Influence production, military unrest).

3. **Round Start/End:**
    - A Global Event card is drawn at the start of each round, applying immediate or ongoing effects to all players.

4. **Artifacts and Spells:**
    - Specific artifacts or spells trigger localized or game-wide events, adding unique twists to gameplay.

5. **Milestones:**
    - Reaching significant game achievements unleashes powerful, thematic events that may benefit or challenge players.

## Event Outcomes

### **Rewards**
- Players gain resources, Renown, or artifacts through beneficial event results.

### **Challenges**
- Some events introduce obstacles, such as:
    - Hex penalties (e.g., reduced resource production).
    - Immediate costs (e.g., losing units or resources).
    - Defending against invaders or quelling rebellions.

### **Choices**
- Many events require players to make strategic decisions:
    - Aid a settlement for Renown at a resource cost.
    - Exploit a magical anomaly for resources but risk long-term penalties.

### **Persistent Effects**
- Certain events permanently affect hexes or the game state (e.g., a hex becomes corrupted and produces no resources).

## Synergy with Other Systems

### **1. High Council Influence**
- Some events may only occur if a motion is passed, reinforcing the political layer of the game. Example: Passing a “Realm Tax” motion leads to increased Gold but reduces Influence.

### **2. Exploration and Risk/Reward**
- Hex exploration becomes a calculated risk, as events can offer rewards (e.g., resources, artifacts) or penalties (e.g., traps, invaders).

### **3. Renown Synergy**
- Certain events grant or deduct Renown based on the player’s choices, reinforcing the fame/reputation mechanic.

### **4. Action Points (AP) Impact**
- Events may modify AP directly:
    - **Example:** “Unrest: Lose 1 AP unless you spend 2 Influence.”
    - **Example:** “Festival: Gain +1 AP this round.”

### **5. Population System**
- Events like famine or rebellion tie directly into the Population System, introducing penalties or opportunities to grow.

## Example Events

### **Exploration Event**
- **Title:** Ancient Ruins
- **Description:** You stumble upon the remains of a forgotten temple.
- **Options:**
    1. Search the ruins.
        - Roll a die: On a 4+, gain 1 Artifact. On 3 or less, lose 1 unit to a trap.
    2. Leave the ruins untouched.
        - Gain +1 Renown for your caution.

### **Global Event**

- **Effect:** Each player loses 2 Gold unless they control at least 1 Farm.

---

### **Localized Event**
- **Title:** Rebellion
- **Description:** The population of a hex revolts against your rule.
- **Effect:** The hex produces no resources until 2 Influence is spent to quell the unrest.
