# Aeonis: Strategy Cards

## Overview

The Strategy Card System introduces a layer of dynamic decision-making and player interaction. Each round, players select one card from a shared pool, granting them powerful abilities to shape their strategy and dictate the initiative order for the turn. These cards create opportunities for both cooperation and competition, as their effects ripple through the gameplay.

## Key Aspects of the Strategy Card System

### 1. Choice and Action

- At the start of each round, players select one Strategy Card from a communal pool.
- Each Strategy Card provides a **primary ability** that the player can activate during their turn in the action phase.
- Players must balance the strength of a card's ability with its **initiative order** value, influencing the sequence of play.

### 2. Draft Order (canon)

Players choose Strategy Cards in **ascending VP order** (lowest VP picks first). This gives trailing players first access to the strongest cards, serving as a built-in catch-up mechanism.

- **Ties:** broken by lowest Renown, then clockwise from the Speaker.
- This order is fixed for the full game and applies to all player counts (2-8).

### 3. Initiative Order

- Every Strategy Card has a **numerical value** (e.g., 1 to 8).
- Lower numbers signify higher initiative, meaning the player with the lowest number acts first during the action phase.
- Players must weigh the benefit of acting earlier against the strength of a card's ability.

### 4. Secondary Abilities

- Each Strategy Card includes a **secondary ability** that other players can trigger when they take specific actions during the round.
- This mechanic creates opportunities for interaction, cooperation, or disruption between players, adding depth to the system.

### 5. Strategic Depth

- The choice of Strategy Card influences both the player's immediate actions and their interactions with other players.
- Players must anticipate their opponents' choices, weigh their own priorities, and adapt their strategy based on the turn order and available cards.

## System Integration

### 1. Replayability

- Strategy Cards are chosen from a **variable pool** each game, allowing for customization and variety.
- For games with fewer players than cards, remove cards randomly or by table agreement before the draft.

### 2. Synergy with Other Systems

- Strategy Cards interact with key mechanics, such as:
  - **Renown System:** Certain cards may grant Renown bonuses or penalties.
  - **Action Points:** Some cards directly increase or reduce AP.
  - **Population System:** Cards like "Expansion Strategy" integrate with Population growth.

### 3. Player Interaction

- Secondary abilities ensure players remain engaged even when it's not their turn.
- Encourages cooperation, competition, and adaptation based on others' choices.

## Optional Variations

### 1. Advanced Strategy Decks

- Introduce faction-specific Strategy Cards tailored to each Lord's playstyle.
- Example: The **Lord of Steel** might have a card that grants free combat strength but delays their turn order.

### 2. Event-Driven Cards

- Certain Global Events may add temporary Strategy Cards to the pool with unique effects for one round.
  - Example: "Meteoric Rise": Gain +1 VP but lose 1 Population.
