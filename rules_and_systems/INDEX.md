# Rules & Systems Index

This folder is the current “rulebook draft” for **Aeonis: The Shattered Empire**.

## Chapters (current)

- **`../playtest/First_Playable_Packet.md`**: Minimal 2–4 player playtest packet (map setup, reduced decks, objectives/events, and Lord sheets).
- **`../components/Components.md`**: Physical component checklist (First Playable).
- **`Lore.md`**: Setting foundation (fall of the empire, Speaking Stones, rediscovered magic, banished lords, artifacts, religion, throne).
- **`Round_Structure.md`**: Canonical timing diagram for a full round (strategy selection → council → rotating actions → production/upkeep → events → cleanup).
- **`High_Council.md`**: Political procedure (speaker, proposals, negotiation, voting, laws/decrees/titles) that other systems reference.
- **`Actions.md`**: Action Point pool + rotating turns; variable action costs; passing and AP banking.
- **`Strategy.md`**: Strategy cards chosen each round; initiative order; primaries + secondaries (TI4-style).
- **`Movement.md`**: AP-based movement, terrain costs, portals/teleportation, and council tie-ins.
- **`Tiles.md`**: Terrain production + buildings; special tiles; extensive control/borders/ZOC framework.
- **`Combat.md`**: Canon combat (battle line + reserves, one battle round per Attack, sieges as the multi-turn exception).
- **`Arcane.md`**: Arcane discovery “tech tree” (schools, tiers, AP + resources), including Lord-specific paths.
- **`Population.md`**: Population pool + cap + growth; unit/building population costs; events and synergy notes.
- **`Trade_Taxes.md`**: Player-initiated trade (AP cost) + upkeep/taxes and consequences of non-payment.
- **`Events.md`**: Exploration/global/local/milestone events; triggers and examples.
- **`Renown.md`**: Renown gains/uses/threshold bonuses; optional decay.
- **`Victory.md`**: VP sources (objectives, council titles, artifacts/buildings, throne, combat captures, events) and optional variants.
- **`Buildings.md`**: Canon building list (including Guild Hall, Bridge), costs, and how buildings interact with Population/upkeep.
- **`TBD.md`**: Brainstorming checklist of “systems we might add” (much of it is now implemented elsewhere).

## Design “red flags” (to decide soon)

- **Combat**: Which model is canon? (single-hex resolution vs adjacent commitment + multi-round phases).
- **Upkeep & constraints**: Population already constrains growth; `Trade_Taxes.md` adds Gold/Mana upkeep too—confirm intended economy pressure.
- **Lakes / water**: Tile definition and traversal rules aren’t fully specified.
- **Terminology**: Keep naming consistent (“Influence”; “Throne of Power” vs “Imperial Seat”).

## Useful “next docs” to add (if you want a complete rulebook)

- `../lords/` folder: individual faction sheets (starting setup, unique ability, unique discovery/building, objective).
