# Rules & Systems Index

This folder is the current "rulebook draft" for **Aeonis: The Shattered Empire**.

## Chapters (current)

- **`../playtest/First_Playable_Packet.md`**: 3-8 player playtest packet (map setup, reduced decks, objectives/events, Lord sheets, and scaling guidance).
- **`../components/Components.md`**: Physical component checklist (First Playable).
- **`Lore.md`**: Setting foundation (fall of the empire, Speaking Stones, rediscovered magic, banished lords, artifacts, religion, throne).
- **`Round_Structure.md`**: Canonical timing diagram for a full round (round start -> events -> strategy selection -> council -> rotating actions -> production/upkeep -> cleanup).
- **`High_Council.md`**: Political procedure (speaker, proposals, negotiation, voting, laws/decrees/titles) that other systems reference.
- **`Actions.md`**: Action Point pool + rotating turns; variable action costs (Build at 3 AP); canonical Recruit rules (costs, placement, limits); passing and AP banking.
- **`Strategy.md`**: Strategy cards chosen each round; initiative order; primaries + secondaries (TI4-style); canon draft order (lowest VP picks first).
- **`Movement.md`**: AP-based movement, terrain costs, portals/teleportation, Cavalry flanking, and council tie-ins.
- **`Tiles.md`**: Terrain production + buildings; special tiles; control/borders; canon ZOC framework (unit-based, not passive control).
- **`Combat.md`**: Canon combat (battle line + reserves, one battle round per Attack, sieges as the multi-turn exception); softened Lord capture (+1 VP, ability lockout).
- **`Arcane.md`**: Arcane discovery "tech tree" (schools, tiers, AP + resources), including Lord-specific paths.
- **`Population.md`**: Population pool + cap + growth; unit/building population costs; events and synergy notes.
- **`Trade_Taxes.md`**: Player-initiated trade (AP cost) + upkeep/taxes and consequences of non-payment.
- **`Events.md`**: Exploration/global/local/milestone events; triggers, examples, and catch-up events (Populist Uprising, Winds of Fortune).
- **`Renown.md`**: Renown gains/uses/threshold bonuses; optional decay.
- **`Victory.md`**: VP sources (objectives, council titles, artifacts/buildings, throne, combat captures, events); 10 VP threshold; 8 VP short-game variant.
- **`Buildings.md`**: Canon building list (including Guild Hall, Bridge), costs, and how buildings interact with Population/upkeep.
- **`Whispers.md`**: Whisper Cards -- shared tactical card deck representing Speaking Stone intelligence and secret preparations. Draw, hand limit, timing windows, 24-card First Playable list.
- **`Artifacts.md`**: Artifact deck (24 unique relics), Remnants, event-driven Artifact Sites, three categories (Lord Equipment, Building Relics, Utility), and VP-bearing artifacts.
- **`TBD.md`**: Brainstorming checklist of "systems we might add" (much of it is now implemented elsewhere).

## Design decisions (resolved)

These items were previously "red flags" and have been addressed:

- **Build AP cost**: Reduced from 4 to **3 AP** (see `Actions.md`).
- **City AP bonus cap**: Capped at **+2 AP from Cities** (see `Actions.md`).
- **Recruit rules**: Canonical Recruit action defined (1 AP, up to 2 units per City, resource + Population costs; see `Actions.md`).
- **Strategy draft order**: Committed to **lowest VP picks first** (see `Strategy.md`).
- **Event Phase timing**: Moved **before Strategy Selection** so events set the tone for the round (see `Round_Structure.md`).
- **VP threshold**: Standard game is **10 VP** (up from 8/12; aligns with TI4 scale). Short game variant at 8 VP (see `Victory.md`).
- **Secret objectives**: Reduced to **2 VP** (same as public) to prevent hidden blowouts (see `Victory.md`, `First_Playable_Packet.md`).
- **Lord capture**: Softened to **+1 VP** (down from 2); "cannot score VP" removed; replaced with **ability lockout** while captured (see `Combat.md`).
- **ZOC rules**: Clarified that ZOC is generated by **military units** (not passive hex control or buildings). Cavalry ignore ZOC penalty on first ZOC hex per Move (flanking). See `Tiles.md`, `Movement.md`.
- **Catch-up mechanics**: VP-based draft order + 2 catch-up global events (Populist Uprising, Winds of Fortune). See `Strategy.md`, `Events.md`.
- **Lord combat stats**: Differentiated across all 8 Lords to match faction identity (previously all identical d8/d8/3HP/2Move).
- **Player count**: First Playable now supports **3-8 players** with scaling guidance (see `First_Playable_Packet.md`).
- **Lord roster (8 Lords)**: Cassian (Human, economy), Seraphel (Human, arcane burst), Vharok (Human, fortress), Elyndra (Elven, growth), Rakhis (Djinnborn, cavalry raids), Nyxara (Umbral, espionage/Whispers), Auriel (Luminari, Renown/council), Thal'rik (Voidborn, portals).
- **Artifact system**: 24 unique relics in a shared deck; Remnant acquisition (3 Remnants = draw 1 artifact); event-driven Artifact Sites; 3 categories (Lord Equipment, Building Relics, Utility); 4 VP-bearing artifacts; full system in First Playable.
- **Buildings overhaul**: Forge/Academy/Bank finalized with concrete effects; upgrade system removed (covered by Arcane Discoveries + Building Relics); 8 Legendary Buildings defined as faction capstones (1 per Lord, 2 VP, +2 Renown, multi-gate prerequisites, 4 AP + resources to build); full building roster in First Playable.

## Remaining design work

- **Terminology**: Keep naming consistent ("Influence"; "Throne of Power" vs "Imperial Seat" -- prefer "Imperial Seat" as canon).
- **Lakes / water**: Core rules are defined (impassable, Bridge exception). Consider adding more water-related events or abilities.
- **Additional Lords**: Roster is now **8 Lords** (sufficient for 8-player games). Long-term goal: a much larger roster of Lords with unique races and playstyles so that every session feels different even at the same player count. Future Lords should explore untapped design space (naval/coastal, necromancy, nomadic alliances, religious schisms, etc.) and introduce new faction mechanics that interact with existing systems in novel ways.
- **Advanced units**: Faction-specific elite/mythic units exist on Lord sheets as "Future Content" but need a system chapter for upkeep and unlock rules.

## Useful "next docs" to add (if you want a complete rulebook)

- `../lords/` folder: 8 faction sheets now exist. Expanding far beyond 8 is a long-term design goal -- each new Lord should bring a unique race, faction mechanic, and playstyle. Consider Lord-specific Arcane paths, legendary buildings, and faction events.
- A **Player Aid** sheet (quick reference for action costs, unit stats, and round flow).
