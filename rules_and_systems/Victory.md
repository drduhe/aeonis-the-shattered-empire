# Aeonis: Victory Points

Players earn **Victory Points (VP)** throughout the game by achieving key objectives, controlling powerful assets, and making strategic decisions. The first player to reach a certain VP threshold (e.g., 12 points) triggers the endgame, with the winner determined by the highest VP total at the conclusion of the round.

## Key Sources

### **1. Variable Objective Cards (Core Feature)**

- At the start of the game, each player draws **two Objective Cards**:
  - **Public Objective:** Revealed to all players and shared. Completing it earns **2 VP**.
  - **Secret Objective:** Hidden from other players. Completing it earns **3 VP**.

- **Examples of Objectives:**
  - **Military Feats:** Control 5 hexes, win 3 battles, or defeat a Lord.
  - **Economic Goals:** Stockpile 10 Gold, build 3 Farms, or control 3 resource-rich hexes.
  - **Cultural Influence:** Construct a Legendary Building or complete a Renown-based milestone.

*Replayability:* Objectives vary by game, encouraging diverse strategies.

---

### **2. Lord-Specific Objectives**

- Each Lord has **unique thematic objectives** tied to their lore and abilities. Completing this earns **1-3 VP** depending on difficulty.
- **Examples:**
  - **Lord of the Arcane:** Cast 5 spells in a single round.
  - **Lord of Steel:** Win 3 battles in a single round.
  - **Merchant Prince:** Gain 15 Gold in one round.

*Why It Works:* Encourages players to lean into their Lord’s identity and play style.

---

### **3. High Council Titles**

- Players earn VP and bonuses by claiming **Titles** through High Council motions.
- **Examples of Titles:**
  - **Warden of the East:** Control at least 3 hexes in a specific region. **(2 VP)**
  - **Hero of the Realm:** Reach 5 Renown. **(2 VP + 1 bonus Renown per round)**
  - **Magister of Mana:** Control 3 Mana-producing hexes or Groves. **(2 VP)**

*Why It Works:* Makes the High Council a critical arena for indirect competition and rewards political engagement.

---

### **4. Artifacts and Legendary Buildings**

- Controlling **Artifacts** or **Legendary Buildings** awards VP based on their significance:
  - **Artifact Control:** Earn **1 VP per Artifact** you control at the end of the round.
  - **Legendary Buildings:** Each Legendary Building is worth **2-3 VP**, depending on its construction cost and impact.

*Why It Works:* Rewards exploration, investment, and strategic control of key tiles.

---

### **5. Throne of Power (Endgame Objective)**

- Controlling the **Throne of Power** (a key tile) provides **1 VP per round** of control.
- If a player maintains control for **3 consecutive rounds**, they gain an additional **2 VP bonus** and trigger the final phase.

*Why It Works:* Creates a dynamic conflict point, encouraging late-game competition for the throne.

---

### **6. Combat and Capture**

- **Defeating a Lord (canon):** When an enemy **Lord unit** is reduced to 0 HP, it is **captured** and you immediately gain **2 VP**. (See `Combat.md`, §2.1.4.)
- **Captured Lords Can’t Score Points:** If your Lord is captured, you can still play but cannot score additional VP until your Lord is released (default: **end of the round**).

*Why It Works:* Adds risk-reward dynamics to aggressive strategies.

---

### **7. Event-Driven Points**

- Specific game events provide dynamic opportunities to earn VP, adding unpredictability:
  - **Example:** A **Dragon’s Hoard** event offers **3 VP** to the first player who defeats the dragon.
  - **Example:** A **Council Crisis** event grants VP to the Lord who resolves it (e.g., by spending resources or Influence).

*Why It Works:* Keeps gameplay fresh and introduces situational opportunities.

---

### **8. Turn-Limited Victory**

- The game can be played with a fixed turn limit (e.g., **10 rounds**) to enhance predictability. At the end, VP are tallied to determine the winner.
- **Tiebreaker:** Most Renown breaks ties, rewarding fame and influence.

*Why It Works:* Provides a structured option for pacing and ensures every round matters.

## Innovative Mechanics to Enhance Victory Points

### **1. Purchased Points (Market for Influence)**

- Players can spend **resources** to buy VP in specific scenarios:
  - **Example:** Use 5 Influence in the High Council to purchase **1 VP** via a motion.
  - **Example:** Use 10 Gold to fund a major event and gain **1 VP**.

*Why It Works:* Adds another layer of economic strategy and resource trade-offs.

---

### **2. Secret Endgame Scoring**

- At the game’s conclusion, certain hidden scoring opportunities are revealed:
  - **Example:** Gain **2 VP** if you controlled the most hexes during the final round.
  - **Example:** Gain **2 VP** if you cast the most spells in the game.

*Why It Works:* Keeps final scoring uncertain, rewarding diverse strategies.
