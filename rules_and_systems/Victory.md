# Aeonis: Victory Points

Players earn **Victory Points (VP)** throughout the game by achieving key objectives, controlling powerful assets, and making strategic decisions. The first player to reach a certain VP threshold triggers the endgame, with the winner determined by the highest VP total at the conclusion of the round.

**Victory Threshold:** First to **10 VP** triggers the final round. Highest VP at end of that round wins.

**Tiebreaker:** Most Renown, then most Influence.

## Key Sources

### 1. Variable Objective Cards (Core Feature)

- At the start of the game, each player draws **two Objective Cards**:
  - **Public Objective:** Revealed to all players. Completing it earns **2 VP**.
  - **Secret Objective:** Hidden from other players. Completing it earns **2 VP**.

- **Examples of Objectives:**
  - **Military Feats:** Control 5 hexes, win 3 battles, or defeat a Lord.
  - **Economic Goals:** Stockpile 10 Gold, build 3 Farms, or control 3 resource-rich hexes.
  - **Cultural Influence:** Construct a Legendary Building or complete a Renown-based milestone.

*Replayability:* Objectives vary by game, encouraging diverse strategies.

---

### 2. Lord-Specific Objectives

- Each Lord has **unique thematic objectives** tied to their lore and abilities. VP values are defined on each Lord Sheet (typically 1-2 VP per objective).
- **Examples:**
  - **Seraphel:** "Ritual Ascendance" -- end a round with 10 Mana and control at least 2 Forest/Grove hexes.
  - **Vharok:** "Unbroken Line" -- control a Fortress hex and win a battle as defender.

*Why It Works:* Encourages players to lean into their Lord's identity and playstyle.

### 3. High Council Titles

- Players earn VP and bonuses by claiming **Titles** through High Council motions.
- **Examples of Titles:**
  - **Hero of the Realm:** Reach 5 Renown. **(2 VP + 1 Influence per round)**
  - **Magister of Mana:** Control 3 Mana-producing hexes or Groves. **(2 VP)**

*Why It Works:* Makes the High Council a critical arena for indirect competition.

### 4. Artifacts and Legendary Buildings

- **Artifact VP:** Only specific named artifacts award VP. Each VP-bearing artifact is worth **1 VP** while you control it (checked at Cleanup & Checks). VP-bearing artifacts:
  - **Crown of Aeonis** (Lord Equipment) — transfers when your Lord is captured.
  - **Eternal Forge** (Building Relic) — transfers when the attached hex changes control.
  - **Shard of the Throne** (Utility) — transfers to the combat winner when you lose a battle where your Lord was present. May also be freely traded.
  - **Imperial Seal** (Utility) — may be purged to prevent a Law or Decree from being repealed.
- **Legendary Buildings:** Each Legendary Building is worth **2-3 VP**, depending on its construction cost and impact.
- See `Artifacts.md` for the full artifact system.

*Why It Works:* VP-bearing artifacts are high-value targets that drive conflict and negotiation. Most artifacts provide power, not points, preventing snowball scoring.

### 5. Throne of Power / Imperial Seat (Endgame Objective)

- Controlling the **Imperial Seat** provides **+1 VP per round** (checked at Cleanup & Checks).
- If a player maintains control for **3 consecutive rounds**, they gain an additional **+2 VP bonus**.

*Why It Works:* Creates a dynamic conflict point, encouraging competition for the center.

### 6. Combat and Capture

- **Defeating a Lord (canon):** When an enemy Lord unit is reduced to 0 HP, it is **captured** and you immediately gain **+1 VP** (see `Combat.md`, section 2.1.4).
- **Captured Lord penalty:** The captured Lord's abilities are **disabled** until release (see `Combat.md`). The captured player may still take turns, score VP, and play normally in all other respects.
- **Release timing:** Captured Lords are released at **Cleanup & Checks** and return to their owner's Home City at full HP.

*Why It Works:* Rewards aggression without creating a feel-bad spiral where the losing player is locked out of scoring.

---

### 7. Event-Driven Points

- Specific game events provide dynamic opportunities to earn VP, adding unpredictability:
  - **Example:** A Dragon's Hoard event offers VP to the first player who defeats the dragon.
  - **Example:** A Council Crisis event grants VP to the Lord who resolves it.

*Why It Works:* Keeps gameplay fresh and introduces situational opportunities.

---

### 8. Turn-Limited Victory (Optional Variant)

- The game can be played with a fixed turn limit (e.g., **10 rounds**) to add predictability. At the end, VP are tallied to determine the winner.
- **Short Game Variant:** Use a VP threshold of **8 VP** instead of 10 for faster games or learning sessions.

*Why It Works:* Provides a structured option for pacing.

## Innovative Mechanics to Enhance Victory Points

### 1. Purchased Points (Market for Influence)

- Players can spend **resources** to buy VP in specific scenarios:
  - **Example:** Use 5 Influence in the High Council to purchase **1 VP** via a motion.
  - **Example:** Use 10 Gold to fund a major event and gain **1 VP**.

### 2. Secret Endgame Scoring

- At the game's conclusion, certain hidden scoring opportunities are revealed:
  - **Example:** Gain **2 VP** if you controlled the most hexes during the final round.
  - **Example:** Gain **2 VP** if you cast the most spells in the game.
