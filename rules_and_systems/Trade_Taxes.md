# **Aeonis: Trade and Taxes**

---

## **1. Trade System**

### **Core Mechanics**

- **Player-Initiated Trade:**
  - A player spends **1 Action Point (AP)** on their turn to initiate a trade.
  - Players negotiate directly and can trade:
    - **Resources:** Gold, Mana, Influence, or Population points.
    - **Promises:** Commitments like military aid, High Council support, or agreements not to attack.
    - **Hexes or Units:** Transfer control of specific hexes or gift units.

### **Advanced Trade Options**

1. **Strategic Favors**:
    - Players can negotiate beyond resources, offering:
        - **Military Support:** “I’ll attack Player C’s army if you give me 2 Gold.”
        - **Hex Control:** “If you don’t attack my City, I’ll give you control of this hex.”

2. **Trade Hubs and Portals**:
    - **Trade Hubs:** Certain hexes, such as **Markets**, provide trade-related benefits:
        - Example: If Player A controls a Trade Hub, they gain 1 Gold for every trade initiated within their region.
    - **Portals:** Trades between players connected by Portals cost **0 AP**, incentivizing Portal control and use.

### **Trade Restrictions**

- **AP Limitation:** Players may initiate trade only once per round, ensuring the trade system doesn’t dominate the action economy.
- **Distance-Based Rules (Optional):** Trades may require proximity, such as adjacent hexes, connected regions, or shared Portals, adding a geographical element to negotiations.

### **Artifact Trade**

During a Trade action, players may also exchange:

- **Remnants**: Any number may be offered or received.
- **Utility Artifacts**: May be freely traded between players.
- **Lord Equipment and Building Relics**: May not be traded. Lord Equipment transfers only via Lord capture (see `Combat.md`); Building Relics transfer only via hex control change.

See `Artifacts.md` for full artifact rules.

## **2. Taxes and Upkeep**

### **Unit Upkeep Costs**

- **Baseline rule (canon)**:
  - **Basic units (Infantry/Cavalry/Archers) have no Gold upkeep.** Their limiting factor is **Population** (see `Population.md`).
- **Advanced units only**:
  - Advanced units may require **Gold, Mana, or Influence** upkeep per round (exact rates defined on the unit or Lord sheet).
  - Example placeholder rates (tune in playtests):
    - **Mage / Elite**: 1 Mana per unit per round
    - **Siege Engine**: 1 Gold per unit per round
- **Failure to Pay Upkeep:**
  - If you cannot pay advanced-unit upkeep, those advanced units **desert** (remove them), starting with the most expensive (or the owner’s choice if tied).

### **Building Maintenance Costs**

- **Advanced Buildings** require ongoing resources to function:
  - Example:
    - **Castle:** Costs 2 Gold per round.
    - **Arcane Forge:** Costs 1 Mana per round.
  - **Failure to Maintain Buildings:** Neglected buildings lose their effects or are downgraded.

### **Consequences of Upkeep Failure**

- **Military Desertion:** Advanced units are removed from the board when upkeep isn’t paid.
- **Building Downgrade:** Advanced buildings are disabled or destroyed if maintenance costs aren’t met.

## **Strategic Implications**

1. **Trade Encourages Diplomacy**:
    - Spending **1 AP** to initiate trades ensures they are deliberate and meaningful, rather than frequent and casual.
    - The absence of formalized agreements creates room for table dynamics, alliances, and betrayals.

2. **Sustainability through Upkeep**:
    - Players must carefully balance growth with their ability to maintain armies and infrastructure, ensuring they cannot recklessly expand.
    - Upkeep failure adds natural penalties, keeping resource management a core part of the game.

3. **Replayability through Negotiation**:
    - The trade system is driven entirely by player interaction, ensuring that every game feels unique as players negotiate, bluff, and form temporary alliances.

## **Example Gameplay Scenarios**

1. **Trade Example:**
    - Player A spends **1 AP** to initiate a trade with Player B:
        - Offer: "I give you 3 Mana for 2 Gold."
        - Player B agrees, and both players exchange resources. However, Player B breaks a verbal promise to support Player A in the High Council, straining their alliance.

2. **Upkeep Failure Example:**
    - Player C controls 3 advanced units that require Mana upkeep but generates insufficient Mana.
        - Player C removes 1 advanced unit due to unpaid upkeep.

3. **Strategic Trade Example:**
    - Player D controls a **Trade Hub** hex. Player E initiates a trade with Player F, exchanging 5 Gold for 3 Mana. Player D collects 1 Gold as a bonus for controlling the hub, strengthening their economy without direct involvement.
