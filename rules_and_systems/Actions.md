# Aeonis: Action Points

## **Overview**

The Action Point (AP) system in *Aeonis* governs the number of actions a player can take during their turn. Players can perform one action per turn within a round, with each action deducting a variable amount of AP from their pool. This system emphasizes strategic decision-making, deepens synergies with other mechanics, and ensures balanced pacing throughout the game.

---

## Turn Structure and Action Limits

1. **One Action Per Turn**
    - Each player may perform one action per turn during the round.
    - The chosen action deducts AP from their pool based on its cost.

2. **Variable Action Costs**
    - Different actions have different AP costs, reflecting their complexity or impact.
    - **Example Action Costs:**
        - Move Units: Pay AP equal to the movement cost of the chosen path for one group (typically 1 AP per hex, modified by terrain and effects). See `Movement.md`.
        - Attack: 2 AP per combat initiated.
        - Build Structures: 4 AP per building constructed.
        - Cast Spells: 1–4 AP, depending on the spell’s power.
        - Activate Strategy Card Abilities: Varies based on the card.
        - Recruit: 1 AP per unit.
        - Research Spells/Upgrades: 1–3 AP, depending on complexity.

3. **Rotating Turns**
    - Players take turns in the order determined by strategy card choices in the Action Phase, performing one action per turn.
    - The rotation continues until all players pass or run out of AP.

4. **Passing**
    - Players may choose to pass on their turn, preserving their remaining AP.
    - Players who pass early may **bank up to 2 unused AP** for the next round.
    - Once a player passes, they cannot take further actions for the remainder of the round.

5. **End of Round**
    - The round ends when all players have passed or when all AP is depleted.

## Starting Action Points

Each Lord begins the game with a unique starting Action Point Pool. Additionally, each Lord may have unique interactions with the AP system, reflecting their playstyle and strengths. These unique traits will be detailed on each Lord’s sheet, allowing for diverse and thematic gameplay.

The Action Point Pool can be expanded during the game through:

- **Renown Thresholds:** +1 AP when reaching 5 Renown, and a free 1-AP action per round at 10 Renown.
- **Constructing Buildings:** Certain advanced structures like the **Guild Hall** provide +1 AP per round.
- **Artifacts:** Acquiring specific artifacts grants temporary or permanent AP boosts.

## Gaining and Spending Action Points

### **Gaining Additional AP**

- **Renown Tiers:** Players gain +1 AP permanently upon reaching 5 Renown. At 10 Renown, players gain 1 free 1-AP action per round.
- **High Council Laws:** Certain laws passed in the High Council may grant temporary or permanent AP boosts.
- **City Control Bonus:** Each controlled City adds +1 AP per round.
- **Buildings:** Advanced buildings, such as the **Guild Hall**, grant +1 AP per round.

### **Spending Action Points**

- **Move Units:** Pay AP equal to the movement cost of the chosen path for one group (typically 1 AP per hex, modified by terrain and effects). See `Movement.md`.
- **Attack:** 2 AP per battle initiated (each Attack resolves one combat round; the attacker may pay +1 AP to “Press the Attack” for one additional round — see `Combat.md`).
- **Build Structures:** 4 AP per building constructed.
- **Cast Spells:** 1–4 AP, based on spell power.
- **Reinforce Hexes:** 1 AP per unit recruited or repositioned.
- **Activate Strategy Card Abilities:** Varies based on the card.
- **Research Upgrades or Spells:** 1–3 AP, depending on complexity.

## Tile, Building, and Event Synergy

### **Tile and Building Synergy**

- **Guild Hall (Advanced Building):** +1 AP per round.
- **City Control Bonus:** Each controlled City provides +1 AP, reinforcing their strategic value.

### **Dynamic AP Events**

- **Famine:** All players lose 1 AP unless they control sufficient food-producing tiles.
- **Festival (Cultural Event):** All players gain +1 AP during the round.
- **Migration:** Temporarily gain +2 AP when controlling specific key hexes or triggering events.

---

## Lord Specific Actions

Each Lord has unique interactions with the AP system, which are detailed on their individual Lord Sheets. These traits can include:

- Reducing the AP cost of certain actions (e.g., building structures, attacking).
- Gaining bonus AP under specific conditions (e.g., controlling certain tiles, passing laws).
- Unlocking powerful abilities that consume AP.

This customization ensures that each Lord has a distinct and thematic playstyle, adding strategic depth and variety to the game.

## Strategic Implications

- **Deepened Synergy:** Population, Renown, and Tiles interact directly with the AP system, creating a unified design that rewards strategic planning.
- **Late-Game Scaling:** AP pools scale with player growth, allowing for more complex turns in later rounds.
- **Player Agency:** Minor tweaks, like banked AP or Lord-specific bonuses, ensure flexibility while maintaining balance.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Event-driven AP shifts create unexpected challenges or opportunities, enhancing replayability.

## Example Scenario

### **Setup:**

A player (Player A) starts the round with 5 AP. They’re competing against two other players (Player B and Player C).

1. **Turn 1:**
    - Player A moves a group of units into an adjacent hex (1 AP).
    - Player B constructs a building (4 AP).
    - Player C casts a spell (2 AP).

2. **Turn 2:**
    - Player A initiates combat in the hex they moved into (2 AP).
    - Player B recruits additional units (1 AP).
    - Player C moves units (1 AP).

3. **Turn 3:**
    - Player A builds a structure in the conquered hex (4 AP), depleting their pool. They must now pass.
    - Player B passes, preserving their remaining AP for the next round.
    - Player C uses their remaining AP to activate a strategy card ability (2 AP).

4. **End of Round:**
    - The round ends once all players have passed.

This updated Action Point System ensures depth, balance, and a strong synergy with the game’s other mechanics.
