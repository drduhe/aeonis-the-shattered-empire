## Research Mechanics

### **1. Action Point Cost**

- Players must spend **Action Points (AP)** to conduct research.
- Research costs range from **1 to 4 AP**, depending on the power and tier of the discovery.

### **2. Resource Cost**

- Researching discoveries costs Mana, Gold, or Influence, depending on the thematic school.
  - Example Costs:
    - Tier 1 Discovery: 2 Mana or 1 Gold.
    - Tier 2 Discovery: 4 Mana or 2 Gold.
    - Tier 3 Discovery: 6 Mana and 3 Gold.

### **3. Unlock Progression**

- Discoveries are arranged in a **tiered tech tree**:
  - **Tier 1:** Basic abilities, cheap and easy to unlock.
  - **Tier 2:** Mid-level abilities, requiring investments in prior discoveries.
  - **Tier 3:** Advanced and game-changing abilities.
- Players must unlock a certain number of Tier 1 abilities to access Tier 2, and so on.

### **4. Unique Lord Discoveries**

Each Lord has a **unique discovery path** that reflects their theme and abilities. These discoveries can only be unlocked by that Lord and add powerful, thematic abilities.

- **Example:** The **Lord of the Arcane** can research:
  - **Mana Nexus:** All Mana-producing hexes generate +1 additional Mana.
  - **Master of Spells:** Reduces the AP cost of casting spells by 1.

## Synergy with Other Systems

1. **Renown Interaction:**
    - Reaching Renown milestones may grant free discoveries or discounts on research.
    - Example: At **5 Renown**, gain a free Tier 1 discovery.

2. **Exploration Events:**
    - Discovering certain hexes may grant research bonuses or even unique discoveries (e.g., ancient ruins with forgotten spells).

3. **Artifacts:**
    - Certain artifacts may grant access to specific discoveries or reduce their cost.
    - Example: The **Tome of Fire** unlocks the Tier 1 Evocation discovery **Flame Burst** for free.

4. **Population System:**
    - Some discoveries may tie into the Population mechanic:
        - **Necromancy:** Requires Population sacrifices for abilities.
        - **Growth Enhancers:** Boost Population Growth via magical means.

5. **Action Points:**
    - Players must balance research with other uses of AP, creating strategic tension.
