# Aeonis: Development Plan

Development Plan: Aeonis
Creating a fantasy equivalent to Twilight Imperium 4th Edition (TI4) with the Prophecy of Kings expansion is a monumental task. It requires replicating its scale, depth, and mechanics while establishing unique and immersive fantasy themes. This document outlines a detailed, phased plan of action to develop the game.
Phase 1: Concept Development
1. Define the Core Vision
	•	Objectives:
	•	Create an epic, narrative-driven strategy board game with a fantasy theme that matches the grandeur of TI4.
	•	Themes:
	•	Replace spacefaring civilizations with fantasy empires (e.g., elves, dwarves, undead, dragon-kin).
	•	Replace galactic conquest with territorial dominion, arcane mastery, or divine ascension.
	•	Explore magical, religious, or mythical equivalents for TI4’s mechanics (e.g., technology trees become magical tomes or blessings).
2. Establish Gameplay Goals
	•	Target playtime: 6–10 hours (mirroring TI4).
	•	Player count: 2–8 (to ensure scalability).
	•	Core mechanics:
	•	Area control and expansion.
	•	Diplomacy and alliance mechanics.
	•	Resource management (e.g., gold, mana, divine favor).
	•	Strategic combat with dice-rolling mechanics.
	•	Asymmetric player lords.






Phase 2: Initial Design
1. LORD Development
	•	Establish 12-16 unique lords.
	•	A mix of starting resources, units, and unique abilities.
	•	Asymmetrical playstyles (e.g., aggressive, diplomatic, arcane-focused).
	•	Lore-rich backgrounds tied to the fantasy world.
2. Map Design
	•	Hexagonal tiles representing regions (mountains, forests, ruins, cities).
	•	A central objective location (e.g., a mythical “Worldtree”).
	•	Variable setup options for replayability.
3. Mechanics and Systems
	•	Resource Management:
	•	Create 3–5 core resources (e.g., gold, mana, food, influence, etc).
	•	Action Selection:
	•	Use a strategy card system (similar to TI4) to drive turn structure.
	•	Include actions like research, conquest, diplomacy, and trade.
	•	Diplomacy and Negotiation:
	•	Develop mechanics for alliances, betrayals, and trade.
	•	Introduce a system for collective decision-making on global events (e.g., a magical council).
	•	Combat System:
	•	Include unit types (e.g., infantry, beasts, siege engines, mages).
	•	Use dice-based resolution with modifiers from spells or unit abilities.
	•	Technology Trees:
	•	Replace with fantasy equivalents like spell research, artifact crafting, or divine blessings.







Phase 3: Prototyping
1. Create Prototypes
• Develop simple versions of the map, lords, and components using cardboard paper and/or 3D printed assets.
• Focus on balance testing core mechanics (combat, economy, diplomacy).
2. Playtesting
	•	Conduct multiple playtests with friends or gaming groups.
	•	Balance lords
	•	Ensure mechanics are intuitive and engaging.
	•	Refine pacing to prevent long downtimes.
3. Iterate and Improve
• Incorporate playtester feedback.
• Revise rules and components to address pain points or unbalanced mechanics.

Phase 4: Refinement
1. Component Design
	•	Custom lord sheets and cards.
	•	Unique miniatures or standees for units and leaders.
	•	Modular, double-sided hex tiles for the map.
	•	Work with artists to develop the game’s aesthetic (e.g., fantasy landscapes, character illustrations).
2. Rulebook
	•	Write a detailed, clear rulebook with examples.
	•	Include a quick-reference guide for new players.
3. Advanced Playtesting
	•	Playtest with a larger, more diverse audience.
	•	Focus on edge cases, advanced strategies, and final tuning.



Phase 5: Production and Marketing
1. Manufacturing
	•	Partner with a manufacturer for high-quality production.
	•	Ensure cost analysis includes miniatures, custom dice, and premium materials.
2. Crowdfunding Campaign
	•	Launch a Kickstarter or similar campaign.
	•	Showcase the game with high-quality visuals and gameplay videos.
	•	Offer stretch goals like additional lords, unique units, or upgraded components.
3. Community Engagement
	•	Build a community of early adopters and enthusiasts through social media and forums.
	•	Share lore snippets, gameplay previews, and behind-the-scenes updates.

Phase 6: Launch and Support
1. Fulfillment
• Deliver the game to backers and distribute to retail channels.
2. Expansions
• Plan for future expansions:
   - Add new lords, mechanics, or scenarios.
   - Explore campaign modes or cooperative gameplay options.
3. Continued Engagement
• Host tournaments or events.
• Release digital tools (e.g., map setup generators, faction randomizers).
